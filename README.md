# Eclipse plugin

Snyk offers IDE integrations that allow you to use the functionality of Snyk in your Integrated Development Environment. This page describes the Snyk Eclipse plugin. For information about all of the IDE plugins and their use, see [Snyk for IDEs](https://docs.snyk.io/ide-tools) in the docs.

The Snyk Eclipse plugin provides analysis of your code, containers, and Infrastructure as Code configurations.

Snyk scans for vulnerabilities, open source license issues, code quality, and infrastructure misconfigurations and returns results with security issues categorized by issue type and severity.

For open source, you receive automated, algorithm-based fix suggestions for both direct and transitive dependencies. This single plugin provides a Java vulnerability scanner or an open-source security scanner.

Snyk scans for the following types of issues:

* [**Open Source Security**](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/) - security vulnerabilities and license issues in both the direct and in-direct (transitive) open-source dependencies pulled into the Snyk Project. See also the [`Open Source docs`](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source).
* [**Code Security**](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/) and [**Code Quality**](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/) - security vulnerabilities and quality issues in your code. See also the [Snyk Code docs](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code).
* [**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security**](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/) - configuration issues in your IaC templates: Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation, and Azure Resource Manager. See also the [Snyk Infrastructure as Code docs](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code).

After you have installed and configured the Eclipse plugin, every time you run it, open a file, or autosave, Snyk scans the manifest files, proprietary code, and configuration files in your project. Snyk delivers actionable vulnerability, license, code quality, or misconfiguration issue details and displays the results natively within the Eclipse UI.

## How to install the Snyk Eclipse plugin

Navigate to the Marketplace from your running Eclipse instance. Search for Snyk and click **Install**.

When prompted accept the license agreement add the **Snyk Security** certificate to complete the installation (this happens only once).

Restart the Eclipse instance:

Once Eclipse is restarted, navigate to **Eclipse Preferences** to ensure that **Snyk** now appears in the list:

<img src="https://github.com/snyk/user-docs/raw/HEAD/docs/.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-05-17 at 16.36.07.png" alt="Eclipse preferences showing Snyk." />

When you open the preferences you can opt out of downloading the CLI through the plugin and thus use your own installation of the CLI.

Continue with the steps to [Download the CLI and language server with the Eclipse plugin](https://docs.snyk.io/ide-tools/eclipse-plugin/download-the-cli-and-language-server-with-the-eclipse-plugin).
