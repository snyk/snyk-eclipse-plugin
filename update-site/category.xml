      Secure development for developers and teams

      Snyk Security finds and fixes security vulnerabilities, infrastructure misconfigurations, and code quality issues
      in your projects early in the development lifecycle to help you ace your security reviews and avoid a costly fix
      later down the line. If you’re an individual developer, open-source contributor, or maintainer at a large organization,
      Snyk helps you ship secure code, faster.

      Security for your entire application
      Comprehensive security for proprietary code, open-source dependencies, and infrastructure as code (IaC)
      configurations—all in one plugin. Whether you’re looking for a Java vulnerability scanner, a custom code
      vulnerability scanner, or open-source security scanner, or an application security plugin.

      Fast, free and accurate results
      Get security analysis of your code, and configurations free of charge. Snyk scans for vulnerabilities
      and misconfigurations in seconds. When returning your results, Snyk Security categorizes security issues by issue
      type and severity.
